Description: The bioinformatic evaluation of gene co-expression often begins with
    correlation-based analyses. However, conventional correlation measures lack validity 
    when applied to compositional data, including count data generated by next-generation
    sequencing. Here we implemented valid alternatives for measuring association between 
    vectors of compositional data. These include several metrics for proportionality, such as 
    phi [Lovell et al (2015) <DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075>] and 
    rho [Erb and Notredame (2016) <DOI:10.1007/s12064-015-0220-8>]. It also implements a
    regularized version of logratio partial correlations [Jin et al (2023) <DOI:10.57645/20.8080.02.8>]. 
    Moreover, this package implements several metrics for 
    differential proportionality [Erb et al (2017) <DOI:10.1101/134536>].
