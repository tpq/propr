Description: The bioinformatic evaluation of gene co-expression often begins with
    correlation-based analyses. However, this approach lacks statistical validity
    when applied to relative data. This includes, for example, biological count data
    generated by high-throughput RNA-sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP),
    ChIP-sequencing, Methyl-Capture sequencing, and other techniques. This package
    implements several metrics for proportionality, including
    phi [Lovell et al (2015) <DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075>] and
    rho [Erb and Notredame (2016) <DOI:10.1007/s12064-015-0220-8>]. This package also
    implements several metrics for differential proportionality. Unlike correlation,
    these measures give the same result for both relative and absolute data.
