Description: The bioinformatic evaluation of gene co-expression often begins with
    correlation-based analyses. However, this approach lacks statistical validity
    when applied to relative data, including those biological count data produced by
    microarray assays or high-throughput RNA-sequencing. Two metrics of proportionality,
    phi [Lovell et al (2015) <DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075>] and rho [Erb and
    Notredame (2016) <DOI:10.1007/s12064-015-0220-8>], both derived from compositional
    data analysis, a branch of math dealing specifically with relative data,
    represent novel alternatives to correlation. This package introduces a programmatic
    framework for the calculation of feature dependence through proportionality, as
    discussed in the cited publications.
