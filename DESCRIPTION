Description: The bioinformatic evaluation of gene co-expression often begins with
    correlation-based analyses. However, correlation lacks validity when
    applied to relative data, including count data generated by next-generation
    sequencing. This package implements several metrics for proportionality, including
    phi [Lovell et al (2015) <DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075>] and
    rho [Erb and Notredame (2016) <DOI:10.1007/s12064-015-0220-8>]. This package also
    implements several metrics for differential proportionality. Unlike correlation,
    these measures give the same result for both relative and absolute data.
