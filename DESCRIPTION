Description: The bioinformatic evaluation of gene co-expression often begins with
    correlation-based analyses. However, this approach lacks statistical validity
    when applied to relative data. This includes, for example, biological count data
    produced by high-throughput RNA-sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP),
    ChIP-sequencing, Methyl-Capture sequencing, and other techniques. This package
    implements two metrics, phi [Lovell et al (2015) <DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075>]
    and rho [Erb and Notredame (2016) <DOI:10.1007/s12064-015-0220-8>], to provide
    a valid alternatives to correlation for relative data. Unlike correlation, these
    metrics give the same result for both relative and absolute data. Pairs that are
    strongly proportional in relative space are also strongly correlated in absolute
    space. Proportionality avoids the pitfall of spurious correlation.
